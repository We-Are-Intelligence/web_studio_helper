# Odoo Studio Helper
This module is data only and can be installed by activating developer mode and clicking Import Module from Apps.
Compatible with Odoo Online Databases

Provides power users with:

* Quick-access menu items for all Studio-touched models, fields, views, menus and metadata.
* Automated cleanup of ``ir.model.data`` references when Studio models or fields
  are deleted — preventing the infamous *"Missing Record"* errors during
  Studio customisation uninstallation.
